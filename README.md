This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## About
Actually, this is a template available on https://w3layouts.com/template/action-coming-soon-web-element/ which was created using HTML,CSS and some jquery for the timer component. As developers are more into using latest technologies such as React and Vue these days, I have created this template into a complete React webapp. It uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) which is a framework based on Reactjs(https://reactjs.org/).

## Some Noticeable changes made in this template compared to the original one
* Completely removed vanilla javascript and jquery to make use of React.
* Font Awesome files have been removed and been used as a dependency especially made for react.
* There may be very little styling change as not everything works as expected in react.

## Important points(Please read this before taking any action regarding this project)
* This is completely open source from my side.
* This template is taken from https://w3layouts.com/ and downloaded for free from there. As this was downloaded for free, I have not removed the backlink and it can be found below in the Footer component. Use this template with the backlink as this is free and licensed.
* You are free to propose changes and point out issues if you find one. Please do so as this will also help me learn the best practices.
